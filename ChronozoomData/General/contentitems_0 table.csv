Traditionally, they were viewed as slow lumbering beasts that lived near swamps to support their weight. They were also usually depicted with their necks craning and moving like those of swans. However, recent research shows that they were more capable of carrying their own weight and their necks were actually more stiff than expected. This was because their size forced them to be built like suspension bridges, with their long necks supported by their tails as counterweights.",0.17,Picture,http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/5b5d27bf-0d58-42b4-9a35-3f34acda7db5_800px-Apatosaurus33.jpg,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apatosaurus33.jpg,????? ,NULL,2B6CD8E0-5833-CEAF-117E-CF74DB7FED1F,7032542D-E692-466A-B846-2688E55F1269,6

The climate was favorable and the continents were breaking apart, creating fertile shallow seas and many miles of coast line which improved rain patterns. These conditions allowed dinosaurs to grow to enormous sizes, as both predator and prey attempted to gain the upper hand on one another. Sauropods were the extreme example, growing to sizes sometimes of over 100 feet in length, they used their size as a deterrent against predators and to control a niche in their environment that no other creature could access. They were eating machines designed to process huge amounts of foliage. And they did so so quickly that they had not time to chew. In fact, they ate small stones so that the plant matter would get ground up within their stomach's. Apatosaurus is probably the most well known of all sauropods, but is likely known by it's older name by many which is Brontosaurus.",0.17,Picture,http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/737fd611-15dd-4bc6-b4e9-bf2b90fb8754_800px-Jobaria_tiguidensis_steveoc.jpg,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jobaria_tiguidensis_steveoc.jpg,Steveoc 86,NULL,2B6CD8E0-5833-CEAF-117E-CF74DB7FED1F,7032542D-E692-466A-B846-2688E55F1269,6

The energy it generates comes from breaking high energy bonds in organic molecules, which is released when these molecules form new low energy bonds as CO2 and H2O. The mitochondria uses that differential to generate ATP, the energy currency of the cell. The basic breakdown of glucose occurs in three steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis actually takes place outside of the mitochondria and involves the splitting of the glucose molecule in half. These halves then move into the mitochondria into the Citric Acid cycle. There the complete breakdown occurs. Finally all these electron carrier molecules pass through ATP synthase and for a total of around 32 ATP per glucose molecule.

To do this, the cell utilizes ribosomes, organelles that are made up of both protein and rRNA, or ribosomal RNA. It is what you would call a ribozyme since it is an enzyme (protein) and a ribonucelotide. The way translation occurs is that the mRNA is fed through the ribosome and this ribosome reads it, three letters at a time. There are 64 different combinations, but only 20 amino acids that make up all proteins, so some amino acids have several three letter codes.

Chromatin is the cell's DNA wrapped tightly around well packed proteins, that are there to protect the DNA from being degraded. The monomers of chromatin are nucleosomes, that bind together into chromosomes when the cell is ready to divide. The nuclear envelope is a double lipid bilayer that likely originated from an infolding of the cells normal membrane meaning the nuclear membrane is twice as thick as the regular cell membrane. Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into mRNA. Most DNA is not actually genes that code for something important, but rather junk DNA that is there to absorb damage and protect the genes from damage, and then most genes aren't expressed in every cell, only a small subset are. The mRNA acts as a messenger of genetic information that exits the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it can be translated into proteins.",1.5,Picture,http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/bc5f97db-be52-42ee-9399-a32b73ac7961_422px-Nucleus_ER.svg.png,http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Nucleus_ER.svg&page=1,Andrew C,NULL,2B6CD8E0-5833-CEAF-117E-CF74DB7FED1F,51B29786-5F4E-42A8-85B2-5D3B0930AE35,5

The function of chloroplasts is to generate organic molecules, especially simple sugars such as glucose, from CO2 and H2O. This is an extremely important function ecologically since it recycles inorganic molecules and creates molecules we can gain sustenance from by using solar energy.

This is because this is the lowest energy state they can be in, and is the basis for a concept known as electronegativity. An element is electronegative if it will try to gain electrons and an electropositive one will try to get rid of them. Oxygen is a good oxidizer, meaning it is good at accepting electrons because it is very electronegative. This makes it very reactive and capable of bonding with many different compounds.

How this works on a molecular level is that plants use photons from the Sun (in the blue and red part of the spectrum, reflecting green back which is what we see) to break the bonds in water and CO2, and form new, higher energy bonds as sugars and they use chlorophyll as a pigment to do this. This sugars can then be broken down to create energy as ATP to power the production of other organic molecules, or used to build cell walls as cellulose, or stored as starch.

Cells will use oxygen's high reactivity to break down complex molecules into simpler ones, and using the energy that process releases to carry their own cellular functions. The simplest version of this is the breakdown of glucose, the product of photosynthesis. It takes place in 3 steps main steps, the first where the glucose is split in half into two pyruvates.

Once oxygen producing organisms arose, many changes occurred to the physical environment. Oxygen caused a great amount of rusting of iron, leaving large formations. Once most iron on earth was rusted, the oxygen would have started to accumulate in the atmosphere, creating the ozone layer, an unstable form of three oxygen atoms bonded together, shielding life from harmful UV rays. However, not all the changes were good, the corrosive nature of oxygen meant that a lot of organisms were either damaged by it or the chemicals they utilized for metabolism disappeared or were confined to niche extreme environments.

Nitrogen is another versatile element that is more abundant in our atmosphere than oxygen. It is a necessity for life because it is required to produce amino acids which make up proteins in our bodies. These proteins carry out every function in the cell from metabolism, to reproduction to movement. Without nitrogen we would not be able to produce these proteins, and that is why it is such an important nutrient in agriculture. Like carbon, it also cycles through the environment with ease, going from gaseous molecular nitrogen (N2), to liquid ammonia, to solid nitrates. About 96% of our mass comes from carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen but many other elements are essential for life such as calcium and sodium and other ions for signaling and enzymatic reactions and phosphorous for DNA.

Long chains of these rings can be made to either store as energy, in plants as starch, and in animals as glycogen, or as structural supports as cellulose, the main component of plant cell walls. Sometimes they aid proteins in cell-to-cell signaling. Lipids or fats are similar but tend to have less oxygen and dissolve more poorly in water.

Life and all it's complexities requires things called ""polymers,"" or long chains of atoms linked together to form complex molecules. Carbon forms the backbone to these polymers and is what all other elements attach to when forming large biological molecules.

It is a double chained molecule, with a phosphate backbone made up of repeating sequences of monomers called nucleotides. There are four letters we use to represent this sequence of code: ATCG. The chains are complementary so A always bonds to T and C always to G. How this information gets expressed is that DNA gets read and transformed into RNA, a similar molecule that is only single stranded and replaces T with U.

It can absorb a lot of energy without raising its temperature much, allowing heat from chemical reactions to dissipate. It is a polar molecule: the oxygen holds the electron's slightly closer to itself than the hydrogens do placing a slight negative charge on the oxygen and a positive charge on the hydrogen. This has many implications for its ability to dissolve ions, needed in metabolism and homeostasis, as well as other polar molecules, allowing cell membranes to form.

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union defined what it means to be a ""planet"" within the Solar System: 1) the oject must be in orbit around the Sun; 2) the object must be massive enough to be a sphere by its own gravitational force; and 3) it must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.

However Ostia’s harbour was too small to admit large ships like those which carried grain, an essential import for the populous capital. Large ships either had to dock further out and have smaller ships unload their cargo piecemeal or dock into the harbour at Pozzuoli and have the cargo unloaded and then taken overland to Rome.   Suetonius notes (Diuus Claudius XX.1) that the creation of a large harbour to accommodate these ships was considered and then abandoned by Julius Caesar in the first century BC as too difficult an undertaking. Despite the enormity of the project and its substantial cost, Claudius initiated the construction of the large artificial harbour on the north side of the Tiber mouth in AD 42.",42,Picture,http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/32212042-5a4d-45aa-9e5f-8a6ec0a315f3_Phase1 Pharos VR.jpg,http://www.portusproject.org,NULL,NULL,2B6CD8E0-5833-CEAF-117E-CF74DB7FED1F,42446679-E1EC-4FE4-8311-050DB18E6841,13

This is because the equation for kinetic energy depends on the mass of the object and the square of its speed. Because the Earth's gravity does a lot to speed up the asteroid, it can reach speeds of several kilometers per second. If the object is small, friction from the atmosphere will tend to vaporize it before it reaches the ground creating meteors, also known as falling stars. But if the object is large, there isn't much that can slow it down and when it collides with earth it unleashes a lot of devastation.

In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of Nobel prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160 and 20 times in three sections originally studied).",65,Video,http://player.vimeo.com/video/24244091,NULL,NULL,NULL,2B6CD8E0-5833-CEAF-117E-CF74DB7FED1F,E1927E04-3683-487C-8194-4B40C130FD0A,7

It is the most recent and infamous for the disappearance of all non-avian dinosaurs. For years the reason behind the extinction event went unknown, until Professor Walter Alvarez discovered a layer of Iridium that suggested an asteroid impact. After many years of research and the discovery of a large crater on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, it is now well established that the demise of the dinosaurs came from outer space. The impact created a tsunami that ravaged the Atlantic coast and the heat from it caused forest fires all over the north America. The rock that was ejected from the impact flew into space rained fire back down onto the earth, making the devastation global.

In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation.

When sexual reproduction appeared, organisms became more resilient because they had two sets of genes and became what is known as diploid. That is why we humans have 46 chromosomes, but we say we have 23 pairs. This allows for interesting mixes in recessives and dominants to allow for more variation and natural selection. The alternation of generations concept is that some organisms live part of their life cycle as haploids and part as diploids. Though we humans only have a short haploid phase as sperm and eggs, some fungi live mostly in a haploid state, while more primitive plants can be half in half living as sporophytes (diploid) or gametophytes (haploid).",840,Picture,http://czbeta.blob.core.windows.net/images/739ad594-9058-40df-beec-7f34352804de_735px-Alternation_of_generations_simpler.svg.png,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alternation_of_generations_simpler.svg,Peter coxhead,NULL,2B6CD8E0-5833-CEAF-117E-CF74DB7FED1F,DD65716F-EBDA-4160-94BC-CFB2B6BF247B,5

Cells that were vast distances away from one another would need to communicate somehow. The endocrine or hormone system is made up of chemical compounds that travel through the blood or transport fluid of the organism to create a reaction in the cell. They can be protein which are usually faster acting such as adrenaline and lipids which usually induce DNA transcription and have longer term effects like steroids. The nervous system is the much faster acting system which uses ion channels to induce electrical currents through specialized nerve cells to send messages. Plants have complex communication systems as well, using pheromones and hormones to signal.

Every division the cell makes is somewhat unequal, with more of certain proteins and organelles originally present in the zygote on one end than on the other. Based on this, certain genes are turned on or off in the daughter cells, and though the actual DNA is still there, how this DNA is used can be very different.

On July 8, 1592, the fleet arrived at the Bay of Sacheon, where the outgoing tide prevented the Korean fleet from entering. Therefore, Admiral Yi ordered the fleet to feign withdrawal, which the Japanese commander observed from his tent on a rock. Then the Japanese hurriedly embarked their 12 ships and pursued the Korean fleet. The Korean navy counterattacked, with their newly completed Turtle Ship in the front, and successfully destroyed all 12 ships.

The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. 2. A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. 3.

The government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from senior first rank (?1?) down to junior ninth rank (?9?) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examinations and recommendations. The power of the bureaucrats often eclipsed that of the central authorities, including the monarch. For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual.
